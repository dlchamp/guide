# Context Menus

These application commands are situated under the "Apps" section when you right-click a user or a message. They act like interactions, except they take a <DocsLink reference="disnake.User" /> or <DocsLink reference="disnake.Message" /> object along with <DocsLink reference="disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction" />.

:::note

For more specific annotations, you can use <DocsLink reference="disnake.UserCommandInteraction" /> or <DocsLink reference="disnake.MessageCommandInteraction" /> instead of <DocsLink reference="disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction" /> for the respective commands.

```python
@bot.user_command(name="User Info")
async def avatar(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction, user: disnake.User):
    await inter.response.send_message(f"Username: {user}\nBot: {user.bot}")
```

<br />

The function below should have only one required argument, which is an instance of <DocsLink reference="disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction" />.

```python
@bot.message_command(name="Reverse")
async def reverse(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction, message: disnake.Message):
    # Reversing the message and sending it back.
    await inter.response.send_message(message.content[::-1])
```

## Context menu notes

-   Context menu commands cannot have subcommands or any other options.
-   Responses to context menu commands and their permissions function the same as slash commands.
